# 2023_BraunA_Adaptive_biasing_of_action-selective_cortical_build-up_activity_by_stimulus_history
Code for Adaptive biasing of action-selective cortical build-up activity by stimulus history. 

The logistic regression model with history bias was fitted using a toolbox from (Fründ et al., 2014), which is publicly available under https://bitbucket.org/mackelab/serial_decision/src/master/. 
Preprocessing of MEG data was done using a Fieldtrip pipeline from (Urai and Donner, 2022), which is publicly available on https://github.com/DonnerLab/2022_Urai_choicehistory_MEG. 
Source reconstruction of MEG data was done using pymeg (Wilming et al., 2020), which is publicly available under https://github.com/DonnerLab/pymeg. 

Raw MEG data are available at https://www.fdr.uni-hamburg.de/record/13475. 
Source reconstructed MEG data are available at https://www.fdr.uni-hamburg.de/record/13197. 
Behavioral data is available at https://www.fdr.uni-hamburg.de/record/13517.
